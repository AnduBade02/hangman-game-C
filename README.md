# ⚙️ C-Based Hangman Game (DSA Project)

## 🌟 Project Overview

This application is a 2D text-based Hangman game developed as a core requirement for a **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** course. This project is proudly associated with the broader European initiative: **"Gender, Digitalization, Green: Ensuring a Sustainable Future for all in Europe."**

The primary goal of this implementation was to solidify theoretical understanding of fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms and apply them to build robust game logic.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation & DSA Focus

The entire application is written purely in **C**, utilizing key programming concepts and data structures:

* **Core Language:** C (The entire project is written in ANSI C for maximum compatibility).
* **Data Structures:** The game relies heavily on **Linked Lists** to manage the underlying game logic, including:
    * Handling the list of available words.
    * Tracking guessed letters and remaining attempts efficiently.

## 🎮 Game Features

* **Multiple Difficulty Levels:** The game includes several difficulty settings, allowing players to choose the level of challenge based on the length and obscurity of the words used.
* **Simple 2D Interface:** The game features a basic, text-based 2D interface. also written in C.

## How to Compile and Run

This project requires a standard C compiler (such as GCC or Clang).
